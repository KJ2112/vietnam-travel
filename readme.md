# 🧠 Hybrid AI Travel Assistant - Complete Solution

A sophisticated AI-powered travel assistant combining vector search (Pinecone), knowledge graphs (Neo4j), and large language models using Ollama for embeddings and Gemini for chat to provide intelligent travel recommendations for Vietnam.

## 🎯 Overview

This system demonstrates advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture by:
- **Vector Search**: Finding semantically similar travel destinations using embeddings
- **Graph Context**: Enriching results with relationship-based information
- **LLM Generation**: Producing coherent, context-aware travel recommendations

   - ✅ `improvements.md`

3. **Documentation**:

   - ✅ Any additional modifications made

### Follow-up Questions Answers

#### Q1: Why use BOTH Pinecone and Neo4j instead of only one?

**Answer**: See `improvements.md` - Section "Why Pinecone + Neo4j?"

**TL;DR**:
- **Pinecone**: Best for semantic similarity ("fuzzy" matching, unstructured data)
- **Neo4j**: Best for explicit relationships (connected data, path queries)
- **Together**: Vector finds similar items, Graph adds contextual relationships
- **Example**: Vector finds "Hanoi", Graph shows connected hotels, restaurants, activities

#### Q2: How would you scale this to 1M nodes?

**Answer**: See `improvements.md` - Section "Scaling to 1M Nodes"

**Key Strategies**:
- Pinecone: Already handles millions; use namespaces & batching
- Neo4j: Add indexes, pagination, caching layer (Redis)
- Application: Connection pooling, request queuing, horizontal scaling
- Estimated cost: ~$200/month for 1M nodes

#### Q3: What are the failure modes of hybrid retrieval?

**Answer**: See `improvements.md` - Section "Failure Modes"

**Main Failures**:
1. Vector-Graph mismatch (no overlap)
2. Cold start (empty cache)
3. Context overload (too much info)
4. API rate limits
5. Stale data synchronization

#### Q4: If Pinecone API changes again, how would you design for forward compatibility?

**Answer**: See `improvements.md` - Section "Forward Compatibility Strategy"

**Strategies**:
1. Abstraction layer (VectorStore interface)
2. Version detection (try-except imports)
3. Configuration-driven (YAML/JSON config)
4. Integration tests in CI/CD
5. Adapter pattern for multiple providers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Module not found" errors**
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Pinecone connection fails**
- Check API key is correct
- Verify internet connection
- Check Pinecone dashboard for service status

**3. Neo4j connection refused**
- Ensure Neo4j is running
- Check URI format: `bolt://localhost:7687`
- Verify credentials

**4. Gemini/LLM errors**
- Add delays between requests
- Verify API quota and model availability
- Use caching (already implemented)

**5. Empty search results**
- Verify data was uploaded to Pinecone
- Check Neo4j has nodes loaded
- Try simpler queries first

### Debug Mode

Add this to test connections:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if config.validate_config():
        print("✅ Configuration OK")
        assistant = HybridTravelAssistant()
        print("✅ All systems connected")
        assistant.close()
```
